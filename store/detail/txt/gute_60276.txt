Witty, compelling, andshrewd, Mansfield’s Book of Manly Men is about resurrecting your inborn,timeless, essential, masculine self.
The Western world is in a crisis of discarded honor, dubiousintegrity, and faux manliness. It is time to recover what we have lost.
Stephen Mansfield shows us the way. Working with timeless maximsand stirring examples of manhood from ages past, Mansfield issues atrumpet call of manliness fit for our times.
“My goal in this book is simple,” he says. “Iwant to identify what a genuine man does―the virtues, the habits, thedisciplines, the duties, the actions of true manhood―and then call men todo it.”
