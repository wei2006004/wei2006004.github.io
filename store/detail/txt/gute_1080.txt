A Modest Proposal is a satirical essay written anonymously in 1729 by the Irish writer and activist Jonathan Swift to protest the government's policies (and his countrymen's heartless attitudes) towards the poor. It remains, today, a classic of the form, and the model for thousands of "modest proposals" published in the centuries since.
