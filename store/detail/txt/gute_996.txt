Don Quixote features two of the most beloved characters in classical literature. Don Quixote and his faithful squire, Sancho Panza, embark on comical exploits that are as charming today as they were when the book was published nearly 400 years ago.
After reading chivalric romances, Don Quixote becomes infatuated with the idea of being a heroic knight and with the help of his squire sets out to do exactly that. Although Sancho's adventures continually get him into trouble, he grows and learns from those mishaps, becoming a character that will enchant the listener long after the last words.
When originally published, Don Quixote was what would today be considered experimental fiction. It would go on to influence some of the most prolific authors in history, including Sterne, Dickens, Melville, as well as a host of others. Modern scholars consider Don Quixote to be the most influential work of literature to come out of the Spanish Golden Age.
