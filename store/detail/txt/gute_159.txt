H. G. Wells called it "an exercise in youthful blasphemy". "The Island of Doctor Moreau" is the account of a Mr. Edward Prendick, a shipwrecked man who washed up on the mysterious island home of Doctor Moreau, a mercurial figure who creates human-like hybrid beings from animals via vivisection. Prendick, as an observer and a guest, goes through an induced madness and an existential crisis in his analysis of his host and the bizarre work he's done in this timeless science fiction classic.
