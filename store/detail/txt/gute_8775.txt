The instant New York Times bestseller from the mysterious and romantic poet Atticus, Instagram sensation and author of Love Her Wild and the Dark Between Stars
In his third collection of poems, Atticus takes us on adventure to discover the truth about magic. Through heartbreak and falling in love, looking back and looking inward, he writes about finding ourselves, finding our purpose, and the simple joys of life with grace, wit, and longing. Whether it’s drinking wine out of oak barrels, laughing until you cry, dancing in old barns until the sun comes up, or making love on sandy beaches, Atticus reminds us that magic is everywhere―we simply have to look for it.
