Arthur C. Doyle intended this 1893 collection of stories to be the last of Sherlock Holmes’s adventures. The thrilling collection starts off with ‘The Adventure of the Silver Blade’, where Holmes investigates the disappearance of a race horse and a murder. It is followed by ‘The Aventure of the Yellow Face’, Doyle’s remarkable attempt at infusing sentiment and discrimination issues in the otherwise pragmatic, logic-induced tales of Holmes and Watson. In ‘The Adventure of the Reigate Squire’, an apparent case of burglary links to a murder. Doyle reveals the great trust between Watson and Holmes as the latter depends on his friend’s timely intervention to save him. After similarly exciting stories, Doyle ends the collection by presenting Sherlock’s greatest nemesis, Professor Moriarty, in the shocker, ‘The Final Problem’. Intended as the last case of Sherlock, it depicts fatal consequences as the extraordinary detective strives to defeat the crafty mastermind.
