On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin was published on November 24, 1859. The book's full title is On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life. This book is a seminal work in scientific literature and a landmark work in evolutionary biology. Darwin's book contains a wealth of evidence that the diversity of life arose through a branching pattern of evolution and common descent - evidence which he had accumulated on the voyage of the Beagle in the 1830s and expanded through research, correspondence, and experiments after his return.
