First shown only to a few friends, it was first printed in pamphlet form, believed to be four copies only, 8pp of text, by John Hay (later Secretary of State). It was rejected by at least one magazine editor and one scholar called it "the most famous piece of pornography in American literature but Twain's friend Rev. Joseph M. Twichell read it and according to Twain "came within an ace of killing himself with laughter". Written in 1876, Queen Elizabeth I, William Shakespeare, Ben Jonson, Sir Walter Raleigh, Francis Beaumont, the Duchess of Bilgewater, the Countess of Granby, and others are gathered around the queen's fireside as fictionally recorded in Samuel Pepys' diary. Meine quotes Twain: "I built a conversation that cound have said he built a conversation which "could have happened--I used words such as were used at the time--1601. I sent it anonymously to a magazine, and how the editor abused it and the sender! But that man was a praiser of Rabelais and had been saying, 'O that we had a Rabelais!' I judged that I could furnish him one." 80 pages
