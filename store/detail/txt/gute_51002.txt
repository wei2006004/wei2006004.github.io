This classic collection of Korean folk and fairy tales is of cultural enormous importance for Koreans and Westerners alike. First published in 1913 but regrettably long out of print, this fascinating little volume is now made available once again for the enjoyment of all who love an ancient tale, particularly if the setting is an exotic one. Of the legends collected here, Mr. Gale has this to say in his preface: "To anyone who would like to look somewhat into the inner soul of the Oriental, and see the peculiar spiritual existences among which he lives, theâ€¦ stories will serve as true interpreters, born as they are of the three great religions of the Far East, Taoism, Buddhism and Confucianism." The stories of classical Korean storyteller Im Bang, in particular, offer to the Western world "that they may serve as introductory essays to the mysteries and, what many call, absurdities of Asia. Very gruesome indeed, and unlovely, some of them are, but they picture faithfully the conditions under which Im Bang himself, and many past generations of Koreans, have lived."
