Charles Dickens’ complete and unabridged holiday classic comes to life in new, vibrant illustrations depicting favorite characters as Black Victorians. It’s 1843. Ebenezer Scrooge disdains Christmas. It’s a waste of time, resources and working hours. Scrooge scowls at his employee Bob Cratchit, his nephew Fred and even street children, who scramble out of his way. He is an unloved man ... until one fateful Christmas Eve. Scrooge is visited by the ghost of Jacob Marley, his long-dead business partner who wishes to change Scrooge’s dreaded fate by warning him that he must change. Three Christmas Ghosts – Past, Present and Yet to Come – offer Scrooge a remarkable, miraculous second chance at a happy life. But, will Scrooge find the courage to take the offer? Washington DC artist Francine Haskins illustrates more than a dozen scenes with Ebenezer Scrooge, Jacob Marley, Mr. and Mrs. Fezziwig, Bob Cratchit, Tiny Tim and the Christmas Ghosts as you have never seen. What do Ossie Davis, Ijeoma Emesowum, Redd Foxx, Whoopi Goldberg, Gregory Hines, James Earl Jones, Daniel Kauluuya, Jenifer Lewis, Jesse L. Martin, Cicely Tyson, Craig Wallace and Alfie Woodard have in common? A special Afterword essay highlights nearly 150 African Americans, Black British and Canadian actors, directors and playwrights who have performed A Christmas Carol over the last century – demonstrating that this classic belongs to us all.
