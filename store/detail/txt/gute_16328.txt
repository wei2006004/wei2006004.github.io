Beowulf is an epic poem that has withstood the test of time. It has been translated and studied for centuries and is a hallmark of academic curricula. It is both an adventure and a tragedy and despite some difficult language is a beautiful story of loyalty and courage in the midst of danger.
This poem is an Anglo-Saxon poem from the eighth century that is set in the kingdoms of Denmark and Sweden. Most of the story had existed long before it was set into writing by an unknown poet. It has rich religious undertones that lend an air of morality to a story with characters that may behave immorally. Many of its characters are based on actual historical figures in the Swedish and Danish royal families.
This work is presented in its entirety along with an author's biography and background, overview, summary, synopsis and analysis, and historical context.
