This little book (3 3/4 X 5 1/2 ") is a classic from over a hundred years ago. It was written by Therese de Dillmont and published by DMC Library. It is truly an encyclopedia of needlework and covers all manner of knitting, crocheting, tapestry work, mending, and embroidery. There are 1087 black and white figures of various stitches plus 13 color plates. In addition to the text, there are several pages at the end describing other books in the DMC Library and pictures and descriptions of the DMC lines of threads and cottons.
