For modern-day adventurers exploring the roots of the old west.
Part fact, part fiction, Mark Twain’s Roughing It takes readers on a high-spirited journey from Missouri to Nevada, California to Hawaii. Travel via stagecoach through woods, plains, hills, and gorges, as Twain spins yarn after yarn on the people he meets, and the towns they explore. Originally published in 1872, this semi-autobiographical semi-prequel to Innocents Abroad satirizes American and Western society in a way that only Mark Twain knows how.
Twain's esteemed wit, paired with the contemporary cover design, makes this a classic that book lovers won't be able to resist.
Born Samuel Langhorne Clemens in 1835, the literary icon worked as a printer’s apprentice, a river pilot, a newspaper reporter, a miner, and even as a confederate volunteer (though he disbanded after only two weeks). Writing under the pen name Mark Twain, he authored many beloved works, including The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Life on the Mississippi River, and A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court.
