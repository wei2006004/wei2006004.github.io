Saki Yoshida used to be your stereotypical unassuming youth. And she knew that! So when she had an opportunity to change her appearance and her personality she jumped on the chance. A little makeover and a willingness to try new things would immediately pay dividends in her life, and felt as if her future was suddenly brighter. Unfortunately, life would come a little too fast for Saki. Romance, home life, school life, money... These were issues she was not quite prepared to take on all at once. But now that her life has changed, there is no stopping progress - whether it is for the better or the worse.
