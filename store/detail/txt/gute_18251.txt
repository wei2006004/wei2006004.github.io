D'Ooge designed this beginners grammar to prepare the student for reading Caesar. The grammar consists of seventy-nine lessons divided into three parts. The lessons are very well structured, gradually introducing new vocabulary and grammar. There is plenty of acummulative knowledge, meaning that you donÂ´t forget what you learnt in previous lessons. Things keep popping back to refresh your memory.
