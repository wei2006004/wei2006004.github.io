A malicious spectre haunts the Parisian Opera house. This murderous fiend speaks through walls, abducts innocents through mirrors, and holds the opera management in a cruel state of hostage. But when this monster falls for the beautiful Christine Daae, his powers of attractive enticement and malevolent mayhem all come to the surface. Who can put an end to this reign of terror? Discover the wonders of Gaston Leroux's gothic thriller in a way that will tantalize the senses. The actual unabridged novel is by far the best way to experience the story of the haunting yet humanistic Phantom of the Opera.
