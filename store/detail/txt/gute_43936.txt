"If we walk far enough," said Dorothy, "I am sure we shall sometime come to some place." A storm tears through rural Kansas and a young farm girl named Dorothy finds herself and her farmhouse swallowed by a cyclone and transported to a magical land called Oz. This unexpected passage into this land of wonders is not without its peril as her farmhouse has fallen on the Wicked Witch of the East. Without pause, the Good Witch of the North appears and presents Dorothy with the Wicked Witch's prized magical silver shoes. The wonders of Oz abound, but Dorothy wants nothing more than to go back home to her family. The Good Witch instructs Dorothy to follow the yellow brick road all the way to the Emerald City, where she must solicit the great and powerful Wizard of Oz for help in returning her back home. Dorothy's journey down the yellow brick road begins uneventful, but with Wicked Witches running amok, will it remain that way?
