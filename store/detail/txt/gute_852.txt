"Democracy and Education" is a truly wonderful book with none of the dogmatic pretense or "scientific methods" features in so many competing treatises. John Dewey's ideas are fresh, original, and beautifully crafted. Rather than presenting Dewey's ideas as explicit recommendations to be implemented, "Democracy and Education" provides a general exploration of educational aims and processes. In "Democracy and Education," Dewey explores closely connected concepts which are left out of other educational texts. His writing is clear and concise. Despite the passage of time, John Dewey remains as one of the greatest educational philosophers. Many of Dewey's catch phrases, such as "learning by doing," are now commonly repeated in educational circles. If you have not done so already, take the time to read "Democracy and Education," and see if you don't agree that it eclipses all other books on education.
