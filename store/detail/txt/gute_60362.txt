Have you ever wanted something so badly that you'd give anything for it? As a child have you ever discovered something terrifying in the forest? How much do you know about your partner and how far can you trust them? What do you imagine coming back from death does to you? You will find all your answers if you look through the Dark Windows...Enjoy...
