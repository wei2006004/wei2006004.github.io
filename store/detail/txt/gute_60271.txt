FROM THE PREFACE: “Einstein’s contributions to our ideas of time and space, and to our knowledge of the universe in general, are of so momentous a nature, that they easily take their place among the two or three greatest achievements of the twentieth century. This little book attempts to give, in popular form, an account of this work.”The text of this addition focuses on the contributions of the two scientists (born 237 years apart) to our understanding of the gravitation phenomenon and to the role played by Einstein’s formulation of his theory of relativity. In a format eminently accessible to the curious modern reader, Harrow offers the a glimpse of two particular moments in a timeline of scientific discovery. As the author states:With the knowledge existing in Newton’s day Newton could have done no more than he did; no mortal could have done more. But since Newton’s day physics—and science in general—has advanced in great strides, and Einstein can interpret present-day knowledge in the same masterful fashion that Newton could in his day. With more facts to build upon, Einstein’s law of gravitation is more universal than Newton’s; it really includes Newton’s.
