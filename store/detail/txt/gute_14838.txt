Once upon a time there were four little rabbits, and their names were Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail and Peter.
The Tale of Peter Rabbit is the delightful tale of the world's most famous and cheeky rabbit. Original story by Beatrix Potter, with colored illustrations by Virginia Albert. A mischievous, but very lovable bunny always inclined to do as he pleases instead of what he should. A wonderful bedtime tale presented in a refined hardcover edition.
