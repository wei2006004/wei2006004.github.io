"The Theory of the Leisure Class" is a classic examination of the economics of the upper classes and the impact that their habits have upon society. In this work Thorstein Veblen coins the phrase "conspicuous consumption" to describe the often wasteful and unnecessary use of resources that is typical of the wealthiest members of a society. Veblen argues that the social values of the rich have greatly contributed to a lack of substantive culture and proper use of wealth in our society. "The Theory of the Leisure Class" is a classic of economics and sociology that is as relevant today as when it was first written.
