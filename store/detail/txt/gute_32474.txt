Excerpt from The Memoirs of the Conquistador Bernal Diaz Del Castillo, Vol. 1 of 2: Written by Himself Containing a True and Full Account of the Discovery and Conquest of Mexico and New Spain The History of the Conquest of New Spain is a subject in which great interest is felt at the present day, and the English public will hail these memoirs, which contain the only true and complete account of that important transaction. The author of this original and charming production, to which he justly gives the title of The True History of the Conquest of New Spain,' was himself one of the Conquistadores; one who not only witnessed the transactions which he relates, but who also performed a glorious part in them; a soldier who, for im partiality and veracity, perhaps never had his equal. His ac count is acknowledged to be the only one on which we can place reliance, and it has been the magazine from which the most' eloquent of the Spanish writers on the same subject, as well as those of other countries, have borrowed their best materials. Some historians have even transcribed whole pages, but have not had sufficient honesty to acknowledge it.
